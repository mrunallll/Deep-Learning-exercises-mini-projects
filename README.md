# Basic Deep Learning exercises/mini-projects

A compilation of basic Neural Networks based exercises/mini-projects 
1. MNIST & EMNIST Digit Classification (ANN model) - Basic handwritten digit classification based on MNIST and extended-MNIST 2 digit dataset.
2. Fashion-MNIST Clothes Classification (CNN Model) - MNIST like dataset consisting of types of clothes images.
3. Dogs-vs-Cats Binary Classifier (CNN Model) (VGG16) - 

Details:
The MNIST Dataset consists of 70,000 handwritten digit images of size 28x28. There are 10 classes present. 0-9 digit classes.

The extended MNIST dataset challenges classification tasks involving two-digits, and shares the same image structure and parameters as the original MNIST.
We train a simple Convolutional Neural Network on both the datasets differently that renders an accuracy of 99.02% for MNIST and 85.19% for EMNIST.
